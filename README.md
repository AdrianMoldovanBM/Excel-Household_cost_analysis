# Romanian household cost analysis
By gathering my household spending data, I conducted a detailed analysis on the expenditure habits of an average Romanian household over a three months period. 

For the research, I split the data into three main categories, taxes, food, and other expenses, each further divided into subcategories.

Analysis was made using Excel functions like tables, power query, power pivot, and charts which helped me better understand daily expenditures, monthly outlays, average monthly spending, and other key financial insights.

For example, I discovered that **60.67%** of the expenditures go on non-food items like clothes, medicine, hygiene goods, fuel, and others, while only **21.62%** goes on food and the rest of **17.71%** on taxes.

Over **63%** of our diet is comprised of processed food and only a small portion includes whole foods like fruits, vegetables, eggs, and dairy. This is connected to the fact that I have included eating out in the same category as other foods.

The implemented charts illustrate spending trends, including category-specific breakdowns, spending patterns, monthly averages, and costs evolution.
